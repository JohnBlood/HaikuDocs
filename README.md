HaikuDocs
=========

## What is the point of the project?

The current documentation for the Haiku User Guide is not easy to edit at all so I thought to myself why not just write new and up-to-date documentation in Markdown and publish it to a git repository so that people can finally easily contribute to it.

## Table of Contents

Below is a list of all the current documents we have to Haiku.

### Bundled software

Below is a list of documents related to all the software that comes pre-installed with Haiku.

1. [**SoftwareUpdater**](docs/bundledSoftware/SoftwareUpdater)
